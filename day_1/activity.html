        We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. All kinds of happy little splashes. Play with the angles.

        That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
        
        Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Even the worst thing we can do here is good. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
        
        It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. This is the way you take out your flustrations. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Let your heart be your guide. Everybody needs a friend. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.
        
        Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.
        
        We can fix anything. Let that brush dance around there and play. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.
        
        We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. It's important to me that you're happy. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. There are no limits in this world. Very easy to work these to death.
